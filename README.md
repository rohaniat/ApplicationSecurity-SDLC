# SpendSmart Application Security & SDLC Analysis

This repository provides an analysis report on the security requirements and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process for SpendSmart, a personal finance management app by Spendology Solutions. The report evaluates security requirements for SpendSmart's new features and assesses the overall security posture of the SDLC phases.

## Files in this Repository

- **ApplicationSecurityAndSDLC.pdf**: A comprehensive report analyzing the security requirements and SDLC phases for the SpendSmart app, with detailed recommendations for improvement.

## Project Overview

### Security Requirements

1. **Data Integration**:
   - **Requirement**: Use encryption during data transmission.
   - **Analysis**: Encrypting data transmission with TLS 1.3 is crucial for security.
   - **Recommendation**: Perform regular audits and implement Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).

2. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - **Requirement**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls (RBAC).
   - **Analysis**: MFA and RBAC adhere to least privilege, improving access security.
   - **Recommendation**: Include adaptive MFA options, like biometrics, and review roles regularly.

3. **Secure Storage**:
   - **Requirement**: Store data using AES-256 encryption.
   - **Analysis**: AES-256 ensures robust data security if key management practices are secure.
   - **Recommendation**: Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key management.

4. **Transaction Logging**:
   - **Requirement**: Log user interactions securely.
   - **Analysis**: Logs should be encrypted and access restricted to prevent tampering.
   - **Recommendation**: Retain logs only as long as necessary and apply anonymization.

5. **User Education and Communication**:
   - **Requirement**: Provide guidance on secure financial practices.
   - **Recommendation**: Update guidance regularly to reflect new security threats.

### SDLC Process Analysis

#### Planning Phase
- **Strengths**: Effective use of tools like Jira and Confluence for requirements.
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of explicit security goals.
- **Recommendation**: Integrate security goals and conduct risk assessments.

#### Analysis Phase
- **Strengths**: Uses tools like Figma and Figjam for visual prototyping.
- **Weaknesses**: No clear data classification or threat modeling.
- **Recommendation**: Define data classification and threat modeling for new features.

#### Design Phase
- **Strengths**: Secure design supported by Enterprise Architect and UML diagrams.
- **Weaknesses**: Lacks specific controls for data protection.
- **Recommendation**: Implement defense-in-depth and input validation.

#### Development Phase
- **Strengths**: Continuous integration via GitLab CI.
- **Weaknesses**: Limited process for managing third-party dependencies.
- **Recommendation**: Use tools like Snyk for dependency scanning and ensure regular reviews.

#### Testing Phase
- **Strengths**: Automated testing with Selenium and Postman.
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of SAST and DAST security tests.
- **Recommendation**: Include SAST, DAST, and regular penetration testing.

#### Implementation Phase
- **Strengths**: Uses Docker and Kubernetes for deployment.
- **Weaknesses**: No deployment script reviews.
- **Recommendation**: Conduct reviews and implement configuration management.

#### Maintenance Phase
- **Strengths**: Monitoring with tools like Datadog.
- **Weaknesses**: Insufficient logging review process.
- **Recommendation**: Regularly review logs and establish automated alerts.

### Summary of Recommendations
1. **Integrate security** in each SDLC phase, starting from planning.
2. **Implement threat modeling** and data classification in the analysis phase.
3. **Enhance security testing** with SAST, DAST, and penetration testing.
4. **Establish proactive patch management** and log review during maintenance.
